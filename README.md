### 🔑 Demo Accounts
All accounts use the default password: **`password123`**

| Role (EN/VN) | Username | Permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin** (Quản trị viên) | `admin123` | Full Audit, User Management, Create Staff |
| **Manager** (Tổ Trưởng) | `demo_manager` | CRUD Users (excl. Admins), Manage Households/Residents |
| **Deputy** (Tổ Phó) | `demo_deputy` | **Read-Only** access to Resident/Household data, View Stats |
| **Accountant** (Kế Toán) | `demo_accountant` | Full Financial Management (Fees, Invoices, Payments) |
| **Resident** (Cư Dân) | `demo_resident` | View personal bills & Profile |

> **Note:** We have removed the 'Lock Account' feature to simplify operations. Deleting a user serves as a soft-delete/deactivation.

  - **Manual Password Reset Flow**: Support for users without email to request password reset via Username (Admin-assisted).
  - **Enhanced Validation**: Stricter input checks for Usernames and Passwords.
- **Household Management**:
  - **Smart UI**: Added **Linked Account** and **Member Count** columns to the main list.
  - **Detailed Insights**: Household Details Modal now tracks associated User Accounts with status.
- **Improved Database Seeding**:

  - **Full Lifecycle**: Includes random Vehicles, Invoices (Paid/Unpaid), and Family relationships.

## 🕒 Previous Updates (v2.2)

  - **Managers** can manage all users *except* Admins. They cannot create, delete, or assign the 'Admin' role.

  - **Admins** retain exclusive control over system configuration and other Admin accounts.
- **Enhanced Security**:
  - **API Protection**: Backend strictly filters Admin accounts from non-admin lists and blocks unauthorized status updates.
  - **UI Consistency**: Buttons and inputs are dynamically hidden based on detailed permission checks.
- **Database Standardization**:
  - Fully migrated all legacy Vietnamese role codes (`quan_ly`, `ke_toan`) to English (`manager`, `accountant`).
